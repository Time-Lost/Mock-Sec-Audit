# Mock-Sec-Audit
This is a mock security audit of a fictional company called Botium Toys. Small U.S. Based company that develops and sells toys from a singular physical location. Their online presence has grown as of recent across the U.S. and abroad and the IT department has been stretched very thin, as it is small, and the manager wants to do a security audit.
